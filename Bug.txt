Part 4 ,

Causes:
Verification is missing  on the card level. 
I noticed in the code that verification is missing to ensure that card belong to person using the card.
Token isn't utilized to check for authorization for card. We see in api call in CardInterface.kt that only the card number is used.
In this case ownership isn't checked and a fraudlent person can use someone else's card.



Fix:

Checking ownership of the card as start

Since the the list of the cards can be pulled using the function, getCard(), 
We can get the user token to see which card is associated with which user so server can check and validate which card (token) belongs to which user (id). 
In case 2 fields match, then the program should allow the transaction. 
This will mitigate the issue , fix the vulnerability and stop the misuse of card  .
